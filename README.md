# CallingApp
This app is a calling App just like the one which is present in our phones.
This app contains a main page which has a dialer and 3 buttons one to fetch call logs, one for contacts and one to set the app as default app.
when the set as default app button is clicked it takes us to the setting where we can select the default phone app.
This app contains proper scroll view to scroll through the call logs and contacts
A fresh modern UI is there.
There is also search bars where we can search for the names .
